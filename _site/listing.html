<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>One of the main concepts that we would like to introduce to visitors and server owners is the concept of <code class="highlighter-rouge">cards</code>. A card is another name for your server listing, bundled up and shown alongside others in a presentable card format. We have invested a huge amount of time in making sure that it is enjoyable and easy to both update and create a listing, there is much more we wish to implement in the future and you can incorporate your ideas on your subreddit at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RagnaRanks/">r/ragnaranks</a> where they will be acted upon and feedback left.</p>

<p>Here we will describe a normal flow of creating a card, the validation messages, required fields and meanings and helping you alongside the process.</p>

<h2 id="starting-out">Starting out</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To begin creating your card, you will be required to have an registered account and be logged in, without having a banned status, you can find the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Add Server</code> option on the top left menu on desktop. <img src="./images/listing/step1.png" alt="alt text" title="Step 1: Click add server menu selection." /></li>
  <li>You should then be presented with a beautiful layout with some preset colors and background to help you get started, we have made sure that this experience is enjoyable and minimal to help the process be as fast as possible.  <img src="./images/listing/step2.png" alt="alt text" title="Step 2: Viewing the add server card page." /></li>
  <li>On first glance it may be unclear, but evidently as you begin to fill out the form you will understand that your changes reflect the preview instantly allowing responsive feedback on how your final card will look <img src="./images/listing/step3.png" alt="alt text" title="Step 2: Responsive feedback" /></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="understanding-the-layout">Understanding the layout</h2>
<ul>
  <li>There is two parts to major parts the card creator layout, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">left pane</code> shows all the <code class="highlighter-rouge">configuration</code> that can be applied to your card and the <code class="highlighter-rouge">right pane</code> shows the <code class="highlighter-rouge">preview</code> of your configurations and how the <code class="highlighter-rouge">final layout</code> will be presented. <img src="./images/listing/step4.png" alt="alt text" title="Step 2: Responsive feedback" /></li>
